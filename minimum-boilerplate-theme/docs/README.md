## Configuration

### **Step 1** -  Basic setup

Access the VTEX IO [basic setup guide](https://vtex.io/docs/getting-started/build-stores-with-store-framework/1) and follow all the given steps. 

By the end of the setup, you should have the VTEX command line interface (Toolbelt) installed along with a developer workspace you can work in.

---
### **Step 2** - Cloning the repository

[Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository to your local files to be able to effectively start working on it.

Then, access the repository's directory using your terminal. 

---
### **Step 3** - Editing the `Manifest.json` an checking dependencies

Once in the repository directory, it is time to edit the `manifest.json` file. 

Once you are in the file, you must replace the `vendor` and `account` values. `vendor` is the account name you are working on and `account` is anything you want to name your theme. For example:

```json
{
  "vendor": "itgloberspartnercl",
  "name": "minumun-theme",
}
```
Before continue be sure the `manifest.json` have all his builders.
```json
"builders": {
    "assets": "0.x",
    "styles": "2.x",
    "store": "0.x",
    "docs": "0.x"
  }
```
 Check the project have all dependencies to work correctly

### **Step 4** -  Installing required apps

In order to use Store Framework and work on your store theme, it is needed to have both `vtex.store-sitemap` and `vtex.store` installed.

Run  `vtex list`  and check whether those apps are already installed. 

If they aren't, run the following command to install them: 

`vtex install vtex.store-sitemap vtex.store -f`




---
### **Step 5** -  Uninstalling any existing theme

By running `vtex list`,  you can verify if any theme is installed.

It is common to already have a `vtex.store-theme`  installed when you start the store's front development process. 

Therefore, if you find it in the app's list, copy its name and use it together with the command `vtex uninstall`. For example:

```json
vtex uninstall vtex.store-theme
```

### **Step 6** - Run and preview your store

Then time has come to upload all the changes you made in your local files to the platform. For that, use the `vtex link` command. 

If the process runs without any errors, the following message will be displayed: `App linked successfully`. Then, run the `vtex browse` command to open a browser window having your linked store in it.

This will enable you to see the applied changes in real time, through the account and workspace in which you are working.
